  <h2 class="headers">Bio</h2>

 <pre><span style="font-size: 20px">
As an aspiring Software Engineer, Ive often looked for ways in which the technologies Im learning can be applied 
to enhance human activities. Above is a list of projects so far where Ive been able to leverage a diverse range 
of tools for a wide variety of applications.

Community involvement 
--Using assessment tools such as WAVE and Lighthouse to detect accessibility issues on a government website


Innovation
--Leveraging the many features offered by Figma to take an idea from a startup company and construct an interface
  that can bring their concept to life 


Online Shopping 
--Implementing multiple capabilities of the React framework to offer an interactive shopping experience featuring
  multilayered filtering, sorting by price, and item accumulation  


Working Remotely
--Exploring how virtual reality can be used for remote work spaces that offer a collaborative environment and
  an “in person” like feeling

As I continue to learn new tools throughout my career, I look forward to making this collection grow</span>
